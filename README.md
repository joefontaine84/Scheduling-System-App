<h1>Scheduling_System_App</h1>

<h2>High-level Overview</h2> 
The goal of this project was to develop a scheduling system application that can be utilized by an international company. The application includes a graphical user interface
that allows the user to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) appointments. The application utilizes a data access object (DAO) design pattern, where the application connects to 
a database hosted in MySQL to retrieve data upon loading and after any data-manipulations are made. SQL files are provided in this repository.
